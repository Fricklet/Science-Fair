# Science Fair Project
Take a look at my mediocre and possibly buggy code.

## What's in it
- Perlin.*: An implementation of Perlin in a language. _Generates a 512x512 Perlin Noise file with 8 octaves_
- Sieve.*: An implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes in a language. _Requires a number argument to count up to._
- Factorize.*: An implementation of prime factorization in a language. _Requires a number argument to factorize._
- noise-viewer.c: A way to view the Perlin noise files that are generated. _Requires a width, height, and file to read from. Uses SDL._
- gen_permutation.c: A way to generate a permutation table for Perlin Noise. _Requires a magnitude, Use 256 for it to work with these Perlin programs._
